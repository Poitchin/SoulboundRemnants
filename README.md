**Overview**
-
This mod let's you keep some items on death. This includes armors, tiered items (tools, weapons) and rare items. 

**How it works**
-
When you open a new world the *keepInventory* gamerule is set to true, and if you die, instead of keeping the whole inventory, only armors, tools, rare items and configured items will be kept, everything else is copied, cleared from you inventory and spawned into the world at the location you died.
